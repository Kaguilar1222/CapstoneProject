    "## Introduction to Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "My final modeling task is to see whether topic modeling extracts any of the key words from our entire corpus of plays - both Shakespeare and non-Shakespeare. It is possible that this is too small of a corpus to extract meaningful insights as often topic modeling is working with huge volumes of text data, ex from Yelp reviews or newspapers. I am using Gensim's Latent Dirichlet Allocation library so that I can also calculate a coherence metric."

We can also adjust the relevance, a method for ranking terms within topics that can be tuned with λ representing the weight given to the probability of each term given topic. The higher the λ, the more the results will be ranked in order of each term's probability to the topic. A lower λ ranks terms solely by their lift(the ratio of a term's probabiltiy within a topic to its probability across the corpus, decreasing the rankings of globally frequent terms, resulting often in rare terms). That results for us in seeing which character name tokens define our topic at λ = 0, and tokens being ranked in terms of topic-specific probability at λ=1."
