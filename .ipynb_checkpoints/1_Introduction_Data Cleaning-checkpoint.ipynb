    "One of the most fascinating debates in literature is the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. My objective with this project is to explore various NLP methods and to use Elizabethan-era plays for a supervised classification task to determine if a play is or is not written by Shakespeare. I have 39 .txt files for plays that were written by Shakespeare (two of which are only partial, more recent attributions) and 50 .txt files that are attributed to Shakespeare's contemporaries.\n",

    "As I am only dealing with a slight class imbalance, I am not making any changes to the data to correct for this when building my authorship attribution models."
